    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>rice</li>
        <li>saffron</li>
        <li>chicken</li>
        <li>vegetables</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Sauté:</b>  Add olive oil to a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, bell peppers and garlic and sauté until onion is translucent. Add chopped tomato, bay leaf, paprika, saffron, salt and pepper. Stir and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Add white wine.</b>  Cook for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Add chicken & rice.</b>  Add chopped parsley and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li><b>Add broth.</b>  Pour the broth slowly all around the pan and jiggle the pan to get the rice into an even layer. (Do not stir the mixture going forward!). Bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to medium low. Give the pan a gentle shake back and forth once or twice during cooking.</li>
        <li><b>Cook uncovered:</b> Cook paella uncovered for 15-18 minutes, then nestle the shrimp, mussels and calamari into the mixture, sprinkle peas on top and continue to cook (without stirring) for about 5 more minutes. Watch for most of the liquid to be absorbed and the rice at the top nearly tender. (If for some reason your rice is still uncooked, add ¼ cup more water or broth and continue cooking).</li>
        <li><b>Cover and let rest.</b>  Remove pan from heat and cover pan with a lid or tinfoil. Place a kitchen towel over the lid and allow to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Serve.</b> Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon slices. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
