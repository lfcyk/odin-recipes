    <p>Doria is a standard popular menu item at Western restaurants. It’s a gratin-like dish with rice. In Japan, it is a dish made by pouring the white sauce over buttered rice or pilaf and grilling it over an open fire. It is similar to gratin but it is a savoury meat sauce over steamed rice, covered with melted cheese and baked in the oven. </p>
